# h6 Upside Down Iceberg

# x) Summarize

## Tor: The second-generation onion router. Design goals and assumptions.
  - Tor-services goals are deployability, usability, flexibility, and simple design.
  - These goals are the basis on which Tor is built upon and they also make it very easy to use.
  - The creators of the article have deferred several "non-goals" because they have been fixed elsewhere, or because they are not yet solved at all. These include not having protocol normalization, or being completetely protected
    against end-to-end attacks.
