# Summarize

## Review
Browsed a few articles on passwords and found A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of Graphical Password Schemes, published by Journal of computer and system sciences.

## Peer reviewed
The Journal of computer and system sciences has a JUFO rating of 3. So I am expecting a high quality study.

## Fresh
The article is from the end of 2020, so not quite the freshest but still relatively new.

# Summary (skimmed, 23 pages)
- Graphical password schemes are systems which use graphical passwords instead of alphanumeric passwords
- Alphanumeric passwords are hard to remember if they are safe, since they have big lenth and entropy requirements. Also the number of unique passwords needed is increasing by the day.
- The SLR compares different graphical password schemes and compares them to each other in different contexts and their resilience against different kinds of attacks.
- There are 4 main categories for different GPSs: Recognition-based, recall-based, cued recall-based and hybrid.
