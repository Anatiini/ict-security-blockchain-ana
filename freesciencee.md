# Summarize

## Review
Browsed a few articles on passwords and found A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of Graphical Password Schemes, published by Journal of computer and system sciences.

## Peer reviewed
The Journal of computer and system sciences has a JUFO rating of 3. So I am expecting a high quality study.

## Fresh
The article is from the end of 2020, so not quite the freshest but still relatively new.

# Summary (skimmed, 23 pages)
- A first systematic literature review based on 56 papers on the topic of graphical password schemes.
- Graphical password schemes are systems which use graphical passwords instead of alphanumeric passwords
- Alphanumeric passwords are hard to remember if they are safe, since they have big lenth and entropy requirements. Also the number of unique passwords needed is increasing by the day.
- The SLR compares different graphical password schemes and compares them to each other in different contexts and their resilience against different kinds of attacks.
- The comparisons are done by the algorithms and techniques used by the scheme, their resiliency against certain kinds of attacks and their use cases or contexts.
- There are 4 main categories for different GPSs: Recognition-based, recall-based, cued recall-based and hybrid.
- There is a wide variety of different algorithms/techniques used by GPSs, like salt algorithm, hashing, encryption et cetera.
- The findings indicate that GPSs suffer from usability if security is emphasized and vice versa. Many of the different methods have problems with memorability or long login times, or issues with security if they don't have the aforementioned issues
- GPSs are mostly used in computer and mobile devices, and out of the 56 papers and their methods, 42 had specific use cases.
- The main purpose of this SLR is to provide insight on different GPSs and their use cases.
