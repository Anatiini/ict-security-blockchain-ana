## Tor: The second-generation onion router. Design goals and assumptions.
  - Tor-services goals are deployability, usability, flexibility, and simple design.
  - These goals are the basis on which Tor is built upon and they also make it very easy to use.
  - The creators of the article have deferred several "non-goals" because they have been fixed elsewhere, or because they are not yet solved at all. These include not having protocol normalization, or being completetely protected
    against end-to-end attacks.

## De-anonymisation attacks on tor: A survey.
  - Increasing popularity of anonymity networks such as Tor, also increases illegal activity and misuse of the anonymity, therefore leading to bigger interest in the de-anonymisation of clients by different LEAs and governments. The survey reviews different de-anonymisation attacks and techniques.
  - Anonymous connection systems are in increased demand to be used for sensitive communication between different millitary or business organizations. Also digital anonymity is very important in totalitarian states.
  - The Onion Router (TOR) project is the most popular anonymity network. Its availability and ease-of-use transfers to it being used as an accessory in cybercrime.
